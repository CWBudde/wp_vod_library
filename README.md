1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CWBudde/wp_vod_library.git
2. Move the folder into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from your WordPress admin.
4. Set the base scan path in Settings > VOD Scanner.
5. Run the scanner manually to import videos.

## Folder Structure (expected input)

Each video should reside in its own folder and contain:

```plaintext
/My Video Folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ video.mp4                # Fallback video
â”œâ”€â”€ HLS/master.m3u8          # HLS stream index
â”œâ”€â”€ thumbnail.jpg/png        # Used as featured image
```

Only folders with:

- Exactly one MP4 file (fallback / download)
- A valid HLS/master.m3u8 file

...will be imported.

## Shortcodes

Embed a single video:

```plaintext
[vod_video id="123"]
```

Render user-accessible video gallery:

```plaintext
[vod_video_gallery]
```

## Access Control

You can assign video access to individual users or by video tags (vod_tag). The plugin syncs and stores access relationships via user meta and post meta fields.
